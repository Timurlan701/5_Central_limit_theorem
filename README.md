# 5_Central_limit_theorem
 
In this problem, the action of the —Åentral limit theorem is verified for the beta distribution. Namely, that for 1000 samples of volume N: 5, 10, 50, 100, the accuracy of the normal distribution increases: the confidence interval narrows, and the probability density function increases.
